		<p>A simple sandwich made from common, easily obtainable 			ingredients.
		</p>
		<ul> Ingredients
			<li>Two slices of bread</li>
			<li>Butter</li>
			<li>Deli sliced ham</li>
			<li>Your choice of cheese</li>
			<li>One egg</li>
			<li>Sriracha</li>
			<li>Mayonnaise</li>
			<li>vegetable oil</li>
		</ul>
		<ol> Directions
			<li class="why">Put vegetable oil in a pan and let it 				heat</li>
			<li class="why">While the pan heats, mix sriracha and 				mayonnaise. Set aside for later</li>
			<li class="why">Butter one side each slice of bread</li>
			<li class="why">By this time, the pan should be hot 				enough. Crack an egg into the time (optional: 				use a spatula or other cooking utensil to 				shape the egg into about the same size as your 				bread</li>
			<li class="why">While the egg is cooking, put your sauce 				on one of your slices of bread. Then, layer 				the ham onto the bread, followed by the cheese 				you selected. Make sure the ingredients inside 				the sandwich are on the NON-buttered side. 				When the egg is done, the heat will help 				melt the cheese!</li>
			<li class="why">When the egg finishes cooking, add it the 				the sandwich. Close the sandwich and put it 				onto the pan with one of the buttered sides 				down.</li>
			<li class="why">When one side is golden brown, flip the 				sandwich so the other side can also brown up
			</li>
			<li class="why">When both sides are done, remove from the 				pan and enjoy!</li>
